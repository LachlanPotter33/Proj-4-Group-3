# <b>Scope</b>
 - <b> Objective of this project is to predict probability of loan repayment among different customer segments</b>.

 # <b>Dataset/Data Model</b>
 - <b>Find Data/Data Source</b> - Quality, quantity and integrity of Data and Data source.
- <b>Data Cleaning</b> - cleansing and preparing data.
- <b>Best fit Algorithm</b> - Find best fit algorithm/Model.
- <b>Model Development</b> - Selection of right parameters  
     for analysis.
- <b>Model Optimization</b> - Improve the model performance
     by making adjustments to the parameters.
- <b>Model Evaluation</b> - Testing the model on sample for
     accuracy.



# <b>Models/Algorithms/Functions used in Exploratory Data Analysis</b>
- <b>Logistic Regression</b>:- Logistic Regression naturally outperforms Linear Regression in predicting the probability of loan default since its outcome contains a continuous range of grades between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of an event occurring.
- <b>Train_test_split</b>:- This function is used to split dataset into two subsets, training set testing set. 
- <b>RandomForestClassifier</b> :- Random forest classifier is a set of decision trees of random subset of training set. It aggregates the votes from decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.
- <b>Random Forest</b> :- Stochastic gradient descent model is an algorithm often used in machine learning to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted and actual outputs.
- <b>Linear SVM</b> :- Support vector machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning to solve classification and regression tasks.
